## Chat Filter
EndorCore has a basic chat filter that isn't too annoying. It bans most swear words, racial slurs, and bad stuff in general. You can still get around it with some censoring which is part of the reason why it's not annoying.

## Polls
One feature of EndorCore that is pretty unique is polls. All you need to do is the poll command and ask the question
*`>poll *question here*`

## Purge
Purge is a command that deletes messages. All you need to do is use the command and add a number(if you don't add a number, it'll delete one message). It'll delete the amount specified PLUS 1(to account for the command itself)
*`>purge *amount here*`
