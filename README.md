# EndorCoreBot
This is a mod bot I made out of boredom.The command prefix is >. ban is to ban others, kick is to kick people, mute is to mute people, unmute is to unmute people, and info is to view the bot info. To view the commands, use >commands. Make sure the EndorCore role is near the top and that the mute role is spelt Mute.
